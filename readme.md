## Responsive Portfolio - Overview

The responsive portfolio is designed with the mobile-first CSS framework, Bootstrap (v4). 
Bootstrap has a grid system that features breakpoints, allowing for built in responsive design.

As you can see above, the content within the card stacks automatically based on the size of the viewport. 
This can be altered by using classes on the columns as follows: 

`class="col-md-3"`
`class="col-xs-12"`

They can also be combined:

`class="col-lg-2 col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-6"`
